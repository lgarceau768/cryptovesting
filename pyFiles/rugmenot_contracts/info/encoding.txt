structures
word
-> (words, operators, function)
-> will interpret the contract line in question accordingly
--->  words (simple noncase biased search)
--->  functions ([inputWord].[function]())
--->  operators [inputWord] [operator]
--->  exist tag (T/F) if exist add score
--->  score - score to be added if exists
-----> file will be used as a defintion check against contracts

idea of functionality
go through line of contract and search for keys of the WOI (words_of_interest.json)
and then if they find a word, create the other search strings to search the line
the word is on. then add to the total score and report if something is triggered
